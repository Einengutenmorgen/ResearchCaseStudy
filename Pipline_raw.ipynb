    "\n",
    "persona= '''\n",
    "Personality Traits\n",
    "Humor Style: The userâs humor is heavily sardonic, often expressed through sarcasm, mocking emojis, and rhetorical jabs. They use humor as a tool to ridicule political figures, ideologies, or groups they disagree with, showing a penchant for sharp, pointed commentary rather than lighthearted banter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Patterns: Their communication is confrontational and assertive, frequently addressing controversial topics with unambiguous language. They often employ rhetorical questions, exclamations, and direct challenges to others, reflecting a combative and unapologetic style. Their posts are rich with hashtags, links, and retweets, emphasizing their intent to amplify messages and engage a like-minded audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Expressions: Emotions conveyed in the posts are intense and polarized, with a strong inclination toward indignation, frustration, and disdain for opposing viewpoints. While negative emotions dominate, there are occasional glimpses of hope or idealism tied to their political aspirations (e.g., their belief in a better future tied to Trumpâs re-election).\n",
    "\n",
    "Values and Beliefs\n",
    "Political Orientation: The userâs posts reveal a right-leaning, strongly conservative ideology, emphasizing loyalty to Donald Trump, criticism of leftist policies, and skepticism toward mainstream media. They appear to prioritize traditional values, constitutional rights, and a disdain for perceived government overreach, as evidenced by their views on voter fraud, civil asset forfeiture, and perceived political persecution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moral and Ethical Viewpoints: The user often frames their arguments within a moral dichotomy of good versus evil, portraying their side as upholding integrity while accusing others of corruption, degeneracy, and hypocrisy. They demonstrate a deep concern for accountability, transparency, and justice but apply these values selectively toward their ideological opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interests and Hobbies\n",
    "Political Activism: Politics is the userâs predominant interest, and their posts reflect a high level of engagement with current events, legislative developments, and political commentary. They actively promote content aligned with their ideology and criticize opposing viewpoints with vigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Media Consumption: Their engagement with platforms like Fox News, Citizen Free Press, and other conservative-leaning outlets suggests a media diet focused on reinforcing their worldview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Media Advocacy: The user utilizes social media as both a battleground for debate and a platform for advocacy. They are keen on exposing perceived injustices and mobilizing others to challenge entities like Best Buy or governmental agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Interactions and Relationships\n",
    "Style of Engagement: The user interacts primarily with political figures, commentators, and ideologues, often tagging them directly in posts. They display a readiness to debate, albeit with a dismissive tone toward opposing views. Frequent use of âmuteâ or âblockâ language suggests they disengage when discussions fail to align with their goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community Dynamics: Their posts cater to a specific in-group of like-minded individuals, fostering a sense of camaraderie through shared grievances and goals. Conversely, they view the out-group (leftists, liberals, or perceived \"establishment\" figures) with hostility and suspicion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coping Mechanisms and Stress Responses\n",
    "The user demonstrates a preference for outwardly channeling their frustrations through pointed critiques and social media activism. They appear to derive a sense of control and catharsis from exposing and challenging those they perceive as threats. Their dismissive tone toward adversaries and reliance on humor suggest a coping mechanism to deflect or diminish stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambitions and Life Goals\n",
    "The user appears to aspire to a societal or political environment aligned with their valuesâcharacterized by what they view as justice, transparency, and traditionalism. Their consistent focus on political outcomes and systemic accountability indicates a long-term goal of influencing or contributing to such change, at least within the realm of public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural and Societal Influences\n",
    "Cultural Background: Their posts suggest a likely affiliation with mainstream American conservative culture, emphasizing values like patriotism, freedom, and limited government. The consistent reference to American political events and conservative media reinforces this cultural identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Societal Context: Their worldview is shaped by a perceived cultural and political battle, with their identity strongly tied to opposition against what they describe as leftist overreach, censorship, and societal degeneration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographics\n",
    "Age: Likely middle-aged (30â50), inferred from their level of political engagement, familiarity with historical political events, and the tone of their humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sex: The tone and focus of their posts lean toward a traditionally masculine communication style, with aggressive language and themes of dominance. This, coupled with their expressed concerns for issues affecting \"white men,\" suggests they are likely male.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural Background: Predominantly Western, specifically American, with a deep engagement in U.S. political discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concluding Profile\n",
    "The user embodies a combative, politically active personality, deeply invested in conservative ideology. Their social media presence is a mix of advocacy, critique, and emotional expression, aiming to influence discourse and rally support for their worldview. They are sharp, confrontational, and unyielding, engaging in debates with a sense of moral certainty. Through their posts, they project an image of resilience and defiance, standing firmly against what they see as a tide of societal and political decay.\n",
